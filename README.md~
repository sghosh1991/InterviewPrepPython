# Repository for Coding Practice

This Repo will contain codes from Elements of Programming Interviews. All codes will be in Python. There will also be other algorithm problems. It is intended to be my central repo for coding/ materials repository which I can use for interviews. I will also put books, class notes, Links in here that I find relevant.
